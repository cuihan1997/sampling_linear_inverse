# Sampling from the Random Linear Model via Stochastic Localization Up to the AMP Threshold

  This repository provides code for the paper ["Sampling from the Random Linear Model via Stochastic Localization Up to the AMP Threshold"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10763).

  * `prior_discrete_distribution.ipynb` provides the algorithm for discrete prior distribution: $P_0(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}\delta_{-1}+\frac{1}{2}\delta_{1}$;
  * `prior_standard_normal_distribution.ipynb` provides the algorithm for standard_normal distribution: $P_0(\theta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{\theta^2}{2})$.
